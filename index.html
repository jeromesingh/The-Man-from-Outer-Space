  <p class="bible">1 Thessalonians 2:10-13 KJV  Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves
  among you that believe:  (11)  As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth
  his children,  (12)  That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.  (13)  For this
  cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it
  not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.

  </p>

  <p class="bible">Acts 1:9-11 KJV  And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out
  of their sight.  (10)  And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in
  white apparel;  (11)  Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is
  taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.

</p>

  <p class="text" >God's people have look for the coming of Jesus.
</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 9:28 KJV  So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear
the second time without sin unto salvation.

</p>

<p class="text">One of the most solemn and yet most glorious truths revealed in the Bible is that of Christ's second coming to complete
the great work of redemption.
  </p>

<p class="bible" >Revelation 6:14-17 KJV  And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island
were moved out of their places.  (15)  And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief
captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the
mountains;  (16)  And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the
throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:  (17)  For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?

</p>

<p class="bible">Jude 1:14-15 KJV  And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten
thousands of his saints,  (15)  To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all
their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken
against him.

</p>

<p class="bible">Job 19:25 KJV  For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:

</p>

<p class="bible">John 8:56-58 KJV  Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.  (57)  Then said the Jews
unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?  (58)  Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 24:1-3 KJV  And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to shew him the
buildings of the temple.  (2)  And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall
not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down.  (3)  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives,
the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy
coming, and of the end of the world?

</p>

<p class="bible">John 7:33-35 KJV  Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
 (34)  Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.  (35)  Then said the Jews among
themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach
the Gentiles?

</p>

<p class="bible">John 7:41-44 KJV  Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?  (42)  Hath not the
scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?  (43)  So
there was a division among the people because of him.  (44)  And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid
hands on him.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 14:4-5 KJV  For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.  (5)  And when he would have put him
to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 14:11 KJV  And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

</p>

<p class="bible">Matthew 14:23-27 KJV  And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the
evening was come, he was there alone.  (24)  But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the
wind was contrary.  (25)  And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.  (26)  And when
the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.
 (27)  But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

</p>

<p class="bible">2 Timothy 2:15-18 KJV  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
dividing the word of truth.  (16)  But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
 (17)  And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;  (18)  Who concerning the truth have
erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.

</p>

<p class="bible">2 Timothy 3:1-8 KJV  This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.  (2)  For men shall be lovers of
their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,  (3)  Without
natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,  (4)  Traitors,
heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;  (5)  Having a form of godliness, but denying the power
thereof: from such turn away.  (6)  For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women
laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,  (7)  Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
 (8)  Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate
concerning the faith.

<p class="text">We shall encounter <b> false claims, false prophets will arise, there will be false dreams and false visions, but preach
  the Word; </b> be not drawn away from the voice of God in His Word.

</p>

<p class="text">I have been shown many who claim to be especially taught of God, and will attempt to lead others, and from mistaken
ideas of duty they will undertake a work that God has never laid upon them. Confusion will be the result. Lt everyone
seek God most earnestly for himself that he may individually understand His will. <b>Selected Messages 2 p. 49.72</b>

<h5>Be Not Deceived
</h5>

<p class="text">There is a class of people who are always ready to go off on some tangent, who want to catch up something strange and
wonderful and new; but God desires us all to move calmly, considerately choosing our words in harmony with the solid
truth of this time.
The truth should be presented to the mind as free as possible from that which is emotional, while still bearing the
intensify and solemnity befitting its character. We must guard against encouraging extremists, those who would be either
in the fire or in the water.
I beseech you to weed out of your teachings every extravagant expression, everything that unbalanced minds and those who
are inexperienced will catch up and which will lead them to make wild, immature movements. It is necessary for you to
cultivate caution in every statement, lest you start some on a wrong track, and make confusion that will require much
sorrowful labor to set in order, thus diverting the strength of the laborers into lines which God does not design shall
be entered, One manifestation of fanaticism among us will close many doors against soundest principles of truth.
